      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair statement, I would agree that we can't say definitively that currently how our economy works is the best way to manage ourselves. There is a lot of historical evidence currently available, that points to ways of organizing a society in times past that are a lot worse than what we have now, ofcourse that does not preclude that there is a better way of organization possible and or on the horizon that we should strive for. To this point, and to the point of this conversation and thread, all of the horrible things humans have done to each other and the downright terrifying ways we have organized ourselves in the past still occurred before the modern concept of money became a means to track economic data, therefore I would surmise that money does cause or even exasperate the horrible tendencies ingrained in human nature. In the absence of resources, humans will do terrible things, money or not.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "***The fact is not everyone needs to feel that they've been \"compensated\" for everything they do and in my opinion, an altruistic system where profit, gain, and personal worth aren't at the centre of economies is where we'll need to go as a species if we expect to continue to progress as a society.***\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone is compensated for everything they do, otherwise they wouldn't do it. Even an altruistic person is compensated by the completion of the action of their philosophy. The compensation comes in the reward of positive feelings, better self awareness, higher self esteem, the knowledge they may have made the world a better place, a person that has been helped, perhaps the avoidance of negative feelings. These are all the things the altruistic person values and therefore are their compensation.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Roughly 1,000 BC the first \"modern monetary systems\". Are we to think that society was any more altruistic during times prior to that? Did personal worth and gain not happen prior to those dates? They did and generally came at the hands of slavery, force bloodshed, death, destruction, invasion, theft, and horrible conditions in abundance like we've never seen in modern times. I agree that progress will come with a more altruistic society where profit and gain are not at the center of desire and the structure of the hierarchy. I don't agree that it will come with an \"altruistic system\". By system you are implying design, how exactly are we to design altruism? By compelled law and force and structure? You can't design an individuals value system.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How exactly do you intend to \"design\" to society a human condition? Again, none of these concepts are caused by Money, a medium of exchange. Take the money away and people will still be trading chickens with each other. You can't create altruism by making it more difficult for people to trade goods. Altruism is a human condition  that will occur naturally  when resource abundance through technology is achieved. I applaud you for wanting that and I'm right there with you, it would be a better society. I would even argue that the best way to achieve resource abundance and more prevalent altruism behavior is to have an efficient economic system that rapidly produces resources in an attempt to reach resource abundance and has a transparent medium for tracking it. Let's take the money away, what will change? Do you think people will stop wanting to collect resources and walk all over their fellow man because you've benevolently removed a portion of economic data?  \n",
      "***We can't solve big problems like climate change without a huge shift in our thinking and a huge part of that is letting go of the need to accrue wealth and have stuff. It is nice to have nice things for sure, but personally, I kind of prefer knowing that my little nephews will have a future in which they can peacefully and happily exist. Capitalism and the monetary system we've all bought into right now absolutely does not value health, happiness, or human life. COVID has shown that beyond any shadow of a doubt.***  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfectly reasonable statement. And I'm right there with you. But this isn't caused by a medium of exchange. It's caused the human condition, powerful phycological methods of self preservation, greed, culture, lack of education, lack of self awareness, lack of empathy and a myriad of other complex social issues that need to be solved. Are we really going to say that Money is the worst thing that people have invented and is causing all of this?  Money is just the data that shows you all of this. It all still exist whether the money is there or not, and always has. We can find plenty of market examples of societies that value the things you put forth more than Americans (I'm assuming we are from the USA), and they use money. In fact, in order to solve some of these issues, the first thing we may say is \"we need to FUND education!\"   \n",

There is no physical law saying we need to use money to exist or that we can't make changes to society because it's too \"expensive\" or will be difficult.***  \n",
      "\n",

      "This is where you go astray. We as a species understand that everything has a cost. Walking across your living room has a cost  (Risk of injury, energy expenditure) , exercising has a cost (calories, energy expenditure, body depreciation, time) eating has a cost (soil, food, transportation, excrement), driving to work has a cost (environmental impact, car depreciation, labor to produce vehicle, time, risk of injury, risk to others) hunting has a cost (The risk of accident and the loss of an animal), gathering has a cost, building something has a cost, producing something has a cost, learning a talent has a cost, intervening in a fight has a cost (you could get hurt), feeding another person has a cost, carrying someone has a cost (the calories you expended doing so had a cost!), me authoring this response has a cost (time, power for the computer which burned fossil fuel!) all aspects of your life you make a cost benefit analysis on why you should or should not do something derived from a risk versus reward analysis you conduct in your head whether you realize it or not. Humans act in a manor to reduce cost to themselves for self preservation. The cost can be very, very difficult to conceptualize which is why we did invent a simple measurement of cost, money!  \n",

      "Let's say you carve a wonderful trinket from a tree, and you give it away, altruistically, instead of charging for it, did it in anyway whatsoever reduce the cost of you making it? Did it change the time you took to cut down the tree? To gather of the materials? To learn the talent of carving? To produce the trinket? Did it change the cost of the loss of the tree? Did it change the cost of all the thousands of years of carbon collection, animals dying for the soil to be nutrient rich, Did it change the cost of all the time and energy required to meet the other party to complete the \"altruistic\" transaction? Did you drive a car to give it away? Did it change the cost of that? The answer to all of these is no, the absence of money in no way changes the cost of anything, you are just removing the ability to provide data that easily consolidates and conceptualizes all of those endless costs. So you want to remove the economic measurement &amp; data that shows us all these costs, what exactly does that accomplish?  \n",
