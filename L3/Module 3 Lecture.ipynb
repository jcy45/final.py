       "'Dear Friends and Colleagues,\\n\\nI always look forward to the beginning of a month, and this one in particular, because it marks the close of one fiscal year and beginning of another.\\xa0 As of last Friday, we closed our books on FY 2011 and, despite the very late start to our peer review process because of the delayed budget cycle, succeeded in getting out all of our awards.\\xa0 This was a Herculean effort on the part of staff throughout the office – the budget and grants financial management staff, program staff, outreach, and all the administrative support.\\xa0 They all worked extraordinary hours to make this possible.\\n\\nAs you know, our Office administers three formula programs and 18 discretionary programs.\\xa0 Formula programs, by definition, are not “competed”, but still require considerable work to process.\\xa0 Our discretionary programs, on the other hand, are competed, and this year the competition was intense.\\xa0 For some programs, the number of applications and amount of funds requested was 10 times that which was available.\\xa0 All of this makes it essential that the review process be thorough and objective, and this requires significant time and effort from staff and, in many instances, from expert reviewers like many of you.\\xa0\\xa0 This is a difficult process, and one which we take very seriously to ensure the most appropriate applications are funded.\\xa0 So, let me congratulate all of those who have received FY 2011 awards, and encourage everyone else to continue checking our website for postings of new solicitations for FY 2012 in the coming months.\\n\\nThe first of a month is also a time to look back on the accomplishments of the past month, and look forward to the highlights of the coming month.\\xa0 We were thrilled to host the third meeting of our National Advisory Committee on Violence Against Women.\\xa0 This select 15-member committee, comprised of advocates, researchers, attorneys, practitioners, survivors, and representatives from law enforcement and courts, is charged with providing advice and recommendations to the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services on ways the federal government can improve its work around children and youth who are exposed to and directly victimized by sexual, domestic and dating violence, and to focus on ways to end the violence that they are exposed to in their homes and communities.\\xa0 The members of the NAC are focusing their efforts particularly around the issues of trauma-informed responses, public outreach, and improving outcomes through evidence-based and practitioner-informed research.\\xa0 We are very much looking forward to the next NAC meeting in December where this important federal advisory committee will continue its efforts to provide guidance to us on how we can end the cycle of violence that traps too many children and youth in our country.\\n\\nIn mid-September at the National Sexual Assault Conference in Baltimore, we had the great pleasure of announcing the six sites selected for the Sexual Assault Demonstration Initiative (SADI, as we call it).\\xa0 The purpose of this demonstration project is to determine best practices and needed action in reaching more sexual assault survivors and providing comprehensive sexual assault services.\\xa0 We hope to develop key tools, methods and strategies that can be disseminated widely to the broader field of dual/multi-service agencies serving sexual assault survivors.\\xa0 The six sites, each of which is receiving a three-year award of $450,000, are:\\xa0 Gila River Indian Community, Sacaton, AZ; Shelter, Inc., Alpena, MI; Doves, Inc., Gering, NE; New York Asian Women’s Center, Inc., NY, NY; Family Violence and Rape Crisis Services, Pittsboro, NC; and SafePlace, Olympia, WA.\\xa0 Congratulations to all of them!\\xa0 We look forward to our partnership with the Resource Sharing Project and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, our Technical Assistance providers, as we move forward in this important work.\\n\\nThis national conference also provided an opportunity to meet with about 50 representatives from our US Territories, including a huge contingent from Guam.\\xa0 All of these grantees travelled incredibly long distances to participate in this conference.\\xa0 I want to thank them for taking the time to share their thoughts about VAWA funding and ideas for how OVW can work with them to achieve our common goals.\\xa0 I also had an opportunity to meet with many representatives from a variety of underserved communities, including African Americans, LGBTQ, disabilities, AAPI, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Latino.\\xa0 Having such opportunities opens doors to productive dialog and understanding of needs that are unique to these populations.\\n\\nMost recently OVW was invited to participate with United States Attorney Brendan Johnson for the District of South Dakota in his Second Tribal Listening Session Addressing Violence Against Women.\\xa0 This Department and indeed this Administration is deeply committed to addressing violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women.\\xa0 Over 200 tribal and non-native leaders joined together to discuss the role of law enforcement and the US Attorney’s Office in investigating and prosecuting cases of violence against women.\\xa0 Particularly focus was placed on the importance of protection orders, and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act to ensure that orders issued by tribal courts are accorded full faith and credit within and beyond tribal boundaries is one of the significant proposals offered by the Department in the upcoming reauthorization.\\n\\nFew reading this will need to be reminded that October is <strong>Domestic Violence Awareness Month.</strong>\\xa0 This is our opportunity to use every occasion to speak out about domestic violence, to challenge misconceptions, to raise awareness, to talk to our daughters, sisters, mothers, sons, brothers, fathers, wives and husbands, friends and colleagues, about the scourge of domestic violence, to safely intervene when someone’s safety is, or is about to be, compromised.\\xa0 It is also a time to recommit to ending violence in all its forms, challenging the misogyny that exists around us, and the degradation and objectification of women and girls.\\xa0 Everyone has a role to play, and every bit helps.\\xa0 Those who fail to take action, who turn away and do nothing, are complicit participants:\\xa0 their inaction condones the very violence we seek to end.\\n\\nThere are so many ways to get involved – personally and professionally, no matter who you are or what you do.\\xa0 Contact us if you need ideas – or start with your local shelter or crisis center.\\xa0 It costs nothing to speak out, but exercising your voice could mean all the difference to someone you may never meet.\\xa0 Collectively we can, we must, do this.\\n\\nLooking into the month ahead, we are excited to be hosting the first-ever National Summit on Campus Safety for College and University Presidents this week.\\xa0 We are bringing presidents from all over the country to mobilize them to provide leadership around ending domestic violence and sexual assault on their campuses.\\n\\nWe will also be hosting our Department colleagues for a discussion about domestic homicide, and what we can do to address this critical issue.\\xa0 Among our special guests will be William Kellibrew and Dr. Neil Websdale who chairs the National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative.\\xa0 We are excited to showcase a video of domestic homicide prepared through our STOP Technical Assistance program.\\n\\nLet me close on a personal note.\\xa0 It was two years ago that I was nominated by the President to become Director of OVW, and this month marks the 18-month anniversary of my having assumed this position.\\xa0 I want to thank everyone, all of our grantees and TA providers, all of the advocates, law enforcement officers, judges, attorneys, prosecutors, SANE nurses, medical and mental health providers, clergy, teachers, coaches, and all the many others, who work to end violence.\\xa0 What you do each day makes a difference.\\xa0 We at OVW look forward to our continued partnership in this work, and to continue listening to and learning from you about new and better ways to meet the needs of victims and survivors, and to hold offenders accountable for their actions.\\n\\nThank you for all that you do, and all that I know you will do.\\n\\nWith gratitude and respect,\\n\\nSusan B. Carbon,\\nDirector\\nOffice on Violence Against Women'"
